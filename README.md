# 🤖 Auto-PM Optimizer

An agentic AI workflow that uses 7 specialized AI agents to generate detailed, grounded Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) — or analyze and improve existing ones.

Built with [CrewAI](https://crewai.com), [Google Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com), [Tavily](https://tavily.com), and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io).

## Features

- **Generate a PRD from scratch** — enter a product idea and 7 agents collaborate sequentially to produce a fully fleshed-out, 10-section PRD grounded in real market data
- **Analyze an existing PRD** — upload a PDF and the Critic agent scores it across 5 dimensions, identifies weak assumptions, blind spots, and missing sections
- **Regenerate an improved PRD** — after critique, the Researcher and Writer agents produce a stronger version that addresses every flagged gap
- **Download outputs** — every generated or improved PRD and critique report is downloadable as a Markdown file

5. Download the result as a `.md` file

### Analyze an existing PRD

1. Open the **Analyze Existing PRD** tab
2. Upload a text-based PDF of your PRD
